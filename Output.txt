Roma had led 3-1 with 20 minutes left before Juve's stunning comeback.
Pellegrini took the spot-kick but Szczesny guessed the right way and palmed the ball clear.
"We did very well for 70 minutes, but after that it was a psychological collapse," Mourinho told DAZN.
However, Juve's comeback began on 70 minutes when Manuel Locatelli headed home Alvaro Morata's cross from six yards.
Paulo Dybala levelled for Juve shortly before half-time with a guided effort into the corner from the edge of the box.
Jose Mourinho said his Roma side suffered a "psychological collapse" after conceding three goals in seven minutes in their defeat to Juventus.
Roma's Lorenzo Pellegrini also had a late penalty saved by Wojciech Szczesny after Matthijs de Ligt had been shown a second yellow card for handball.
Defender Mattia De Sciglio then sparked scenes of delirium among the visiting players when he drilled home the winner into the bottom corner from inside the area.
The win keeps Juventus fifth and three points behind Atalanta, who sit fourth in the final Champions league spot after thrashing Udinese 6-2. Roma stay in eighth place.
"When you're in trouble you're supposed to get back up and show what your made of, but there are people in the changing room here who are a bit too nice, a bit too weak."
There was still time for more drama inside the final 10 minutes when centre-back De Ligt was sent off for a second bookable offence after blocking Abraham's shot with his arm in the area.
Two minutes later, substitute Dejan Kulusevski saw his close-range range strike initially ruled out for offside, but the decision was overturned after a lengthy video assistant referee check.
Mourinho's side, who had loan signing Ainsley Maitland-Niles in the starting XI for the first time, went ahead on 11 minutes when Tammy Abraham nodded home Jordan Veretout's near-post corner for his 14th goal in all competitions this season.
Henrikh Mkhitaryan restored Roma's lead at the start of the second half when his long-range effort deflected off Daniele Rugani and looped over Szczesny, before Pellegrini curled a stunning 25 yard free-kick into the top corner to put the home side seemingly on course for a comfortable victory.
